    "This is the same thing as in the first worksheet, except that I manually put in a different priority function.  This is a priority function that some playing around with FunSearch suggested was pretty good.  We have only done a few trials, but the sets produced in this way seem to be noticeably larger than the sets produced by a fully random greedy algorithm.  Interesting!"
